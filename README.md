# Pegu Labs Legal Documents Readme
##### January 4, 2012

Hi! Welcome to our project where we store our legal documents for Pegu services like Advicedrop and Alumnifire.
We plan to maintain a revision history of those documents here so you can see how things change over time. It
seems only fair.

Right now we're keeping track of:
* the Advicedrop [Terms of Service](/terms_of_service.md),
* the Advicedrop [Privacy Policy](/privacy_policy.md),
* the Alumnifire [Terms of Service](/alumnifire_terms.md), and
* the Alumnifire [Privacy Policy](/alumnifire_privacy.md),

but we may add other important documents here over time.

Thanks for reading! And if you have questions or concerns you can always contact us at
[feedback@advicedrop.com](mailto:feedback@advicedrop.com).

Sincerely,  
Your friends at Team advicedrop
