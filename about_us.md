Thanks for visiting Pegu!

Pegu is a marketplace for independent professionals to share their expertise
with people that need it to help with daily projects and hobbies. If you’ve
ever found yourself feeling like a little personal advice would go a long way
toward helping you fix that leaky faucet, repair that broken fence or gauge the
cost of that home improvement project you’ve been eyeing, then you’ve come to
the right place because Pegu is for you. Internet searches are too time
consuming, impersonal and spotty. On Pegu, a trusted and trained perspective
from a vetted expert is quick and affordable.

If you've found your way here on your own, Pegu is currently in a closed alpha.
But, if you're interested in getting expert advice custom tailored to the
situations that you run into on a daily basis, we'd love to hear from you.
Email [feedback@pegulabs.com](mailto:feedback@pegulabs.com) for more. We hope
to be expanding very soon.
