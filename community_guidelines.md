# Pegu Community Guidelines

Our community guidelines help keep Pegu safe and clean. Please give them a
read. Some of what you read here repeats ideas you've read in the [Terms of
Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy). Keep in mind that these are
guidelines to make the service better, but the Terms and Privacy Policy are the
legal contracts that govern use of Pegu.

## 1. Guidelines for everyone who uses Pegu

The guidelines in this section are our general community rules for using Pegu.
They addresses some basic do’s and don’ts as well as common questions that
might come up using the service. If you have any questions or think something’s
missing or unclear, email us at
[feedback@pegulabs.com](mailto:feedback@pegulabs.com) and let us know!

### 1.1 Do
* Share links to other resources (even you think they might be competitive with
  Pegu) that can help another user with their issue.
* Tell us if something’s going wrong. You can reach us at
  [peguapp.com/help](https://www.peguapp.com/help).
* Let us know if you are unsatisfied with an answer or interaction you’ve had
  on Pegu. Use the help link above or just email
  [feedback@pegulabs.com](mailto:feedback@pegulabs.com).
* Let us know if you see other people violating the guidelines.

### 1.2 Don’t
* Create a negative experience for others. For example, don’t send
  inappropriate or offensive content through Pegu, don’t bully other users,
  call people names, YELL, or do other things your mother told you not to. Let
  us handle disputes rather than getting into an argument.
* Dispute charges from PEGUAPP.COM Q&A on your credit card. If you have a
  dispute, email us at [feedback@pegulabs.com](mailto:feedback@pegulabs.com).
* Share personal information with experts or other users of Pegu. This could be
  your home address, email address, phone number, bank account information, or
  other personal information. This rule helps protect you from people that
  might take advantage of your information.
* Use Pegu to spam others.

### 1.3 FAQ
#### When will my credit card be charged? What happens if I’m not satisfied?
We use a partner called [Balanced Payments](https://www.balancedpayments.com/)
to handle all of our payment processes. Balanced lets us create an escrow, so
that we can charge you when you ask a question, but we don’t pay the expert
until you’re satisfied with the answer. We have a 100% satisfaction guarantee,
so if you aren’t happy with your answer we’ll either try to find a way to fix
it or give you your money back.

#### What do I do if I don’t get an answer?
Most experts will get back to you within 24 hours, either with an answer or an
update letting you know how long it will take to create an answer. If you feel
like you’ve given fair time for a response and haven’t heard anything, just
email us at [feedback@pegulabs.com](mailto:feedback@pegulabs.com). For the time
being we’ll handle situations like these manually, but we plan to build better
tools to handle these situations long term.

#### What happens if the answer is fair, but I’m not happy with it?
We want everyone who uses Pegu to feel great about it, but, you may get an
answer that feels something like “actually, in this case you can’t fix it
yourself, you need to hire someone,” which is fair, but probably not what you’d
hoped the answer would be. When this happens, we encourage our experts to give
you as much information as they can, including why you shouldn’t do it yourself
and how much you can expect to pay someone. We also hope that you look at this
type of answer as a bit of extra confidence and trust that the decision to hire
someone is the right one.

## 2. Guidelines for experts on Pegu

The guidelines in this section are here to help experts manage expectations,
address unclear situations, and keep clients happy when answering their
questions on Pegu. If you think something’s missing or have a question about
anything included here, please email us at
[feedback@pegulabs](mailto:feedback@pegulabs.com). Thanks for reading!

#### What do I do if a Pegu client is a good lead for my business?
You will be speaking with potential leads for your business, and we think it's
great if your effort on Pegu leads to jobs. However, make sure you do a couple
things if you see an opportunity:

1\. Answer the question in full before proposing additional services. It's
important that clients feel good about their experience on Pegu and they won't
take you up on your offer if they think you're just fishing for jobs. In fact,
it's often better to let them make the suggestion.

2\. To protect your security, our Terms of Service prohibit sharing personal
information (like your phone number or email address) with other users. Be
careful with what you share with others. A good idea might be to sign notes
with your name and a link to your website (which is public, not personal
information).

#### What if I can't answer a client's question?
You may get a question that isn't quite right for your expertise. You may not
know the answer, or you may think that another expert might be better suited to
answer it. If this happens, we'll have to handle the situation manually so let
us know about it as soon as you can. You should also let the client know he or
she won't be charged, and don't close the question. You can also refer the
client to another expert if it makes sense. We plan to build tools in the near
future to make this easier.

#### What's a fair response for a $25 question?
For the moment, every question on Pegu is $25, but we recognize that's not very
flexible. We want to weed out the simple questions that can be easily answered
by the internet in other ways (like a Google search), so you're only getting
questions that are personal or complex and require your expertise. Rely on your
gut to determine what's fair, but you may run into a couple situations:

1\. Some clients may ask a question that is particularly involved or has
several parts to it, and requires too much effort to answer to be worth $25 to
you. Use your judgment to determine the fair line here, but if it happens try
suggesting that the client either break the question into multiple questions or
limit the scope so that it makes sense for you to answer it. You should also
give them an opportunity to decide not to ask the question, and if they choose
that option contact us (and don't close the question). This is another area
where we hope to build tools to make the experience better (and could use your
help figuring out what those tools should be!).

2\. Some clients may ask you a question on the other side of the spectrum,
where you feel that they may be disappointed by the simplicity of the answer,
or that the advice is unwelcome (for example, "unfortunately you can't fix that
and need to replace it"). Keep in mind that value comes in many forms, and you
shouldn't underestimate how much your experience, perspective, and opinion is
worth. Many clients take comfort in knowing that an expert is weighing in on
their personal situation and leading them to the right decision, even if it's
simple. Detailed specifics, tone, personality, and the feeling of a 1:1 touch
all contribute to the value clients get from you on Pegu, and in situations
like these an extra personal touch keeps clients happy and asking more
questions.

#### How quickly should I respond to client questions?
As quickly as you can, of course! Ideally this means you can provide a complete
answer within 24 hours, but some cases require more time and research to answer
well. If you can't answer that quickly, you should send the client a note
within 24 hours to let them know that you've received the question and you're
working on it, and give them an honest reason why it'll take longer to answer.
Most every client will be understanding as long as you set expectations.

#### When should I close a question?
When you close a question, a note is sent to the client that you believe your
answer is sufficient. The client can then agree, in which case you are paid
right away and everyone's happy. If the client doesn't respond at all, we'll
send a 24 hour reminder, and then a 48 hour reminder. If the client doesn't
respond by the 48 hour reminder, we'll close the question automatically and pay
you. So, it's in your best interest and we recommend that you close the
question as soon as you believe you've given a full response and solved the
client's issue. You also can't close the question through email, you'll need to
visit the site and use the "close" button on the message thread.

#### What happens when I go on vacation and can't respond for a few days?
If there will be periods of time when you are unable to respond within 24
hours, you should "deactivate" your expert account (you can always "reactivate"
when you're back). To do this, go to your profile (the "Be an Expert" link will
send you there) and use the "Manage" button on the right side of the page below
the image banner. Within "Manage" you'll see a link to deactivate your profile.
We'll make this smoother over time as well and give you more control over
vacation handling.

#### How can I help make this more successful?
Thanks for asking ;) The best thing you can do to make both yourself and Pegu
successful is share your profile with as many people as you can. When you
create your profile you'll get a pegu.me link (you can see one at
pegu.me/triptate) that you can use to put an "ask me a question" link on your
website, blog, or email signature. We're also fully open for business now, so
if you have friends who you think would make good experts, let them know to
visit the site or send them to us at
[feedback@pegulabs.com](mailto:feedback@pegulabs.com).
