## Grouplicate Privacy Policy (Beta)

*Note:* During the Beta, not all features referenced below may be available.

### March 20, 2020

Grouplicate, found at [www.grouplicate.com](/), is owned and operated by Alumnifire, Inc. (dba **“Grouplicate”**).

This Privacy Policy (the **“Policy”**) applies to the site and services available at www.grouplicate.com and all applications and services that link to this Policy (collectively, the **“Service”**).

### Intro

At Grouplicate, **we take you and your data seriously**. We believe everyone has a right to control how his or her data is used. We believe in being crystal clear with you about what we do with your data. We believe you should be able to "pack up and go" at any time. That’s why we created a special **“Me and my Data”** section of our Service and feature it so prominently.

We prepared the following Privacy Policy to explain clearly how we handle your data and how we strive to protect all of our users’ data.

In this Policy, we’ll cover:

* Information about your identity and your content
* Your group’s leaders and their access to your information
* Tracking
* Cookies and web beacons
* Service providers and partners
* Third party sites
* Security and encryption
* Age restrictions
* Notifications
* Jurisdictions and international transfer
* Changes to the Policy

You'll also want to read our [Terms of Service](/terms), which is our contract with you governing your use of Grouplicate.

### 1. Information About Your Identity and Your Content

This is your business, not ours. We don’t share your identity or your content with advertisers, marketers, or third parties outside of your group and its leaders. Third parties outside of your group cannot pay Grouplicate to target you based on your personal data or your content on Grouplicate. While we do our best to protect your identity at all times, we are law-abiding and will disclose personally-identifying information when required to do so by law.

While we respect your content, illegal activity, objectionable content, misrepresentation, and hateful or threatening content are not permitted on the Service. If we are made aware of such activity or content, we will take appropriate action. Please refer to our [Terms of Service](/terms) for a list of activities that are not permitted on Grouplicate and for the actions we may take with violators of this policy.

### 2. Your Group’s Leaders

Your group has designated administrators, leaders and staff (**“Group Leaders”**). Like other members, Group Leaders have access to your public profile and the personal information that you add to it. To help Group Leaders manage group activities and success, we offer them an administrative toolset. Group Leaders can also pay for additional tools that give them access to analytics and data about the performance of their group and its membership. Analytics and data in these tools would contain aggregated and anonymous member log data, group engagement information, and profile data that members agreed to share with Group Leaders when they signed up. We would only transfer additional personal information to Group Leaders with your express, opt-in consent.  Group Leaders can also pay for the ability send messages to different segments of their groups that share common profile and usage characteristics (e.g. “Members who have logged in in the past 6 months” or “Members who have posted an event”).

You always can review your Group Leaders’ administrative access and adjust your privacy settings in the “Me and My Data” section of the Service.

### 3. Tracking

We don’t track you to sell your data to third parties outside your group. However, to ensure the satisfaction, security, and safety of our users, we monitor how our members use the Service. In addition to monitoring traffic, usage activity, feature popularity, and site performance, we may collect user log data, including IP address, browser type, email addresses, phone numbers, and standard cookie data like device type and network information. We do this to verify membership accounts, identify misconduct, prevent spam, protect the integrity and security of the Service, and maintain the reliability of the Service.

We also may also share and match your information against databases or with third parties bound by confidentiality who help us to deliver a safe, secure, and dynamic platform.

### 4. Cookies and Web Beacons

"Cookies" are small data files that are transferred to your computer, through your browser, for record-keeping. Cookie usage is a common practice for many websites and is mostly used for good. However, cookies can also be abused. For example, they can be used to help third parties target you for advertising.

Grouplicate DOES NOT use cookies so third parties outside your group can target you or better market to you. We use cookies to improve your experience. For example, we use cookies to remember your preferences and settings, and to let you log in and out of your group without having to re-enter your name and password. We also use cookies to let us know how many people are using certain features on the Service and how often they’re doing it, and to let us know how many people open our emails. Using cookies this way allows us to constantly improve our platform to better serve you and your group.

Many browsers allow you to turn "off" cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. Choosing not to accept cookies will affect the functionality of most services, including ours.

"Web Beacons" are electronic images (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze the performance of an online service. Our use of web beacons, and that of our trusted partners, is typically limited to analytic services and tasks, like determining if you've opened an email.

### 5. Service Providers and Partners

We work with select third-party service providers that support Grouplicate and help to ensure our members’ groups thrive. These third-party providers provide services such as hosting, newsletter delivery, and payment processing. We may share your information with these service providers on the condition that they use your personal data only on our behalf and consistent with the Policy.

If you make payments on the Service, we use third-party payment service providers for payment processing; to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, and other prohibited activities; to assist in dispute resolution like chargebacks or refunds; and for other reasons associated with using a credit or debit card.

### 6. Third-Party Sites

The Service offers you the ability to connect and link to third party websites, including but not limited to, social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. When you visit one of these third party sites through a link on the Service, you are no longer protected by Grouplicate's Privacy Policy. If you share your activity to any third party site, such site will have access to the content you’ve chosen to share but will not be able to access your account.

Grouplicate does not control the privacy practices of these third-party sites and some of them have starkly different views about privacy than we do. We, therefore, encourage you to read their respective privacy policies. Grouplicate is not responsible for the privacy of your information and activity on these sites.

### 7. Security and Encryption

To protect your privacy and information, the Service uses multiple security procedures and practices. When you enter personal information on the Service, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is a web security standard that creates a secure connection between our web servers and your browser and protects your data from unauthorized access. Your personal information is password-protected and our main servers are locked by our hosting provider.

While we strive to exceed industry standards to protect your personal information, no method of transferring such information over the internet or storing it digitally is 100% secure, nor can we guarantee the absolute security of your information.

We will of course make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable laws and regulations on security breach notification). These notices will be provided without unreasonable delay, taking into consideration the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the integrity of the Service. In other words, if we need to stay quiet about a breach to help the good guys catch the bad ones, we'll do that until the coast is clear.

While we’re on the subject, **we will never request your credit card or banking information, your account ID, login password, or any other private personal information in a non secure or unsolicited email or phone call.** If someone claiming to represent Grouplicate does ask for such information unsolicited, DO NOT provide it.

### 8. Age Restrictions

We do not knowingly allow children under age 13 to use the Service, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. Additionally, we require that anyone younger than 18 interested in using the Service obtain their parent or guardian's consent.

If you are a parent or guardian and find that your child has provided personal information on the Service without your consent, email us. We will make every reasonable effort to delete such information from our databases.

### 9. Notifications

You may receive notifications and updates from us after registering on the Service. For example, we may send you notifications when something happens that might interest you, like:

* Another member sends you a message
* There is new activity or content on the Service
* We've added a new feature to the Service

Or, when there's something that you need to know, like:

* Your profile is incomplete
* We've made a change to the Terms or Policy

We use your personal information and settings to determine what notifications you receive, and we may use contact information like your email address, phone number, or mailing address to contact you. You can opt-out of these notifications in “Me and My Data.”

### 10. Invitations

You may choose to use the Service to invite people to join a group. If you choose to do this, you have the choice to invite individual friends or contacts to connect with you on the Service using a personalized link or by sending SMS (text message) or e-mail invitations. If you provide such contact information, the Service will store a copy of the phone numbers, emails, and names provided on our servers. This information is only used to provide you with the ability to invite new members to your group.  You are responsible for all necessary consents required to send such invitations, regardless of delivery method.

### 11. Your Rights and Choices Regarding Your Information

__Your Data Portability__: At any time you can retrieve your entire personal information package from Grouplicate in the “Me and My Data” section of the Service. When you select this feature, you will be able to download your data to your personal device and decide how to migrate that data anywhere you choose.

__Deleting Your Account__: At all times you have an easy way to opt out of our Service and delete your account as well as ALL of your personal information, if you do not wish to continue using the Service. To delete your account, visit the “Me and My Data” section and elect to “Edit Your Account and Profiles.” There you will find a button to “Permanently Delete Your Account.” When you delete any of your Content Data (as defined in the Terms), or delete your entire account, we delete your Content Data and remove your account from our production servers as soon as is technically possible based on our infrastructure design. After we’ve deleted your Content Data from our production servers, that same data may remain in our backups for a limited period of time (up to 180 days) due to protection regulations and our protocols for backup content protection. If we ever need to restore our production database from our backups (in a rare instance, for example recovering from a natural disaster), and if at that time any of your Content Data you have previously deleted from our main servers remains on our backups, it may be restored during the recovery process and it may be impossible for us to determine your intention to delete your account based on the state of the data in the backup database. Should such an event occur, all members with accounts remaining on the Service will be notified of the backup actions taken, and will have an opportunity to retake any desired deletion actions at that point. If you are a Group Leader and delete your account, your personal profile for such group will be deleted; however, the group(s) you lead will not be deleted unless you are the only member of that group.

If you decide to delete your Grouplicate account, we won't keep any of your account data. However, there may be occasions where we need to keep some content that you've created or uploaded. For example, if you've sent a message to someone else through the platform, we'll keep a record of the message for the member that received it. If you included personal data in such a message, we won't be able to tell, and may be unable to remove it. For this reason (among others) we recommend that you avoid including personal information in messages that you send others online.

Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information that we have collected and used under certain circumstances that go beyond what we have outlined above, which may include the following:*

* You may request that we provide you for the last 12 months a list of the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which it was collected, the business purpose for collecting or “selling” the information, and the categories of “third parties” to whom we disclosed or “sold” that information. You may make a request to know up to two times in a 12-month period, subject to limitations described in the law. For a list of general categories of information that we have collected and shared in the past 12 months, see the descriptions above.
* You have the right to be free from discrimination for using these rights. We will not deny you goods or services, or charge you different amounts because you used one of these rights.

\* If you are a resident of a jurisdiction where one or more of these rights are granted to you under applicable law, and you wish to exercise any such rights listed above, please contact us by either:

* Email: [legal@grouplicate.com](mailto:legal@grouplicate.com)
* Mail: 37 W 26th Street, Suite 207, New York, NY 10010

In addition, you may also access your personal information or delete your account as described above.

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. Please understand that we may be required to verify your request and may require you to provide some information to enable us to carry out such verification. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

### 12. Jurisdictions and international transfer

Grouplicate operates in the United States and processes information described in the Policy here in the U.S. Additionally, we work and share data as described in the Policy with third parties who may perform their activities in other countries. As a result, your information as shared with Grouplicate and our partners may be subject to the laws of jurisdictions outside your own, and those laws may not afford the same privacy and data protection laws as your home jurisdiction's, particularly regarding demands or requests for information from government entities. By using our Service, you agree that your information may be collected, transferred, stored, and processed in the United States and in other countries.

### 13. Changes to the Policy

From time to time, we may update the Policy. Sometimes those changes will be small, like correcting typos or changing the wording of a phrase or two. We won't bother you when that happens. But when a change is material, we'll either email all of the registered users of the site, or we'll post a conspicuous notice on the Service prior to the change becoming effective. If our changes are unacceptable to you, we understand. We make it easy for you to delete or adjust your account and settings.

If Grouplicate is acquired by or merged with another company or a similar corporate transaction takes place, we may share information about you with the other company. In such a case, we will notify you with a prominent notice on the Service or by sending notice to the email address listed in your account before transferring your information.
