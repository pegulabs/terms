# advicedrop Privacy Policy
##### January 4, 2012

## Summary

Hi! You've found advicedrop and our Privacy Policy. This document describes what
personal information you give us when you use the Service and what we're
allowed to do with it. We take your privacy very seriously, so please read
through the Privacy Policy to make sure we're on the same page. If you haven't
read our [Terms of Service](/terms) yet, you should. It's our contract with you
that defines how we work together. It also defines a bunch of helpful key words
that make it easier to write legal documents. Those words mean the same thing
here in the Privacy Policy that they do in the Terms, unless we tell you
otherwise.

Additionally, the terms **"using"** and **"processing"** information refer to
any of the following activities: using cookies on a computer, analyzing
collected information and using or handling such information in any way,
including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying,
deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our
organization or among our affiliates within the United States or
internationally.

advicedrop, found at [https://www.advicedrop.com/](https://www.advicedrop.com/), is owned
and operated by Pegu Labs, LLC.

## 1. The basics

### 1.1 Scope of the policy

The Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide us through our
Service. Our Service may contain links to other websites or services, in
particular we currently use a partner called Balanced Payments (and in the
future may use others) to handle financial transactions. If you visit another
website through a link on our Service, this Privacy Policy will not apply to
any information collected on that website, because we are not responsible for
the privacy practices, security, or content of these other websites. We
recommend that you read the privacy policies of each website that you visit.

### 1.2. Updates to the policy

By using the Service you consent to this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we
may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices.
If we make any material changes we will notify you by email at the e-mail
address associated with your advicedrop Account or with a conspicuous notice on the
Site and App prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of the
Service constitutes your consent to the changes. If you wish to opt out, you
can email us at [feedback@advicedrop.com](mailto:feedback@advicedrop.com) and we
will respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe. However, we are not
responsible for removing your Personal Information from third party partner
databases.

### 1.3 Protection for children

As stated in the [Terms](/terms), our Service is not for children under 18. We
do not knowingly collect Personal Information from persons under the age of 18.
If you are a parent or guardian and find that your child has provided Personal
Information on our Service, email us at
[feedback@advicedrop.com](mailto:feedback@advicedrop.com). If we are informed that
a person under 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we'll make all
reasonable efforts to delete such information from our databases.

## 2. The types of information we collect about you

The reason we collect any information at all from you is to make our Service
better. That information can be classified in the following ways.

### 2.1 Personal Information

**"Personal Information"** is information you provide to advicedrop that can be used
to identify you personally. You can take advantage of some basic features
without providing Personal Information, but to register for the Service or take
advantage of all the features, you'll need to provide additional information
that qualifies as Personal Information, such as:
* basic information like your name, phone number, email address, mailing
* address, or profile picture; login information like your username and
* password; payment information like your credit card number, expiration date,
* security code, billing address and other billing details, bank account
* number, or bank routing number; biographic information like your skills,
* certifications, interests, needs, or expertise.

### 2.2 Settings

**"Settings"** are pieces of information that you provide to us that cannot
identify you personally, but are associated with your Personal Information.
These include account settings and preferences like notification settings,
sound settings, favorites, or other types of preferences. We use this
information to tailor the Service to you specifically, and we may also
aggregate this information with other users' information to analyze the
performance of the Service.

### 2.3 Log Data

**"Log Data"** are pieces of information sent to us from your browser when you
visit our service. These may include your computer's IP address, your browser
type, other webpages you've visited or transactions you've completed, certain
demographic information like your physical location, and other statistics. We
collect and use this information to help understand and analyze the performance
of our site and better tailor the experience to users' needs. For example, we
may modify the site for the specific browser you are using. We do not treat Log
Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal
Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information.

### 2.4 Interactive Information

**"Interactive Information"** is information that you provide us through your
interactions on the Site or App. This information may include which pages or
sections of our Site or App that you visit, the time you spend on those pages
or sections, information and terms you search for, Exchanges you complete,
Providers that you use, and specific times that you access the Service. While
we don't consider this information Personal Information, we may combine it with
your Personal Information to serve you better. For example, we may store the
Providers you use on a regular basis within your advicedrop Account so you can access
those Providers more easily later on.

### 2.5 Cookies

**"Cookies"** are small data files that we transfer to your computer for
record-keeping. Cookie usage is common practice for many websites. We utilize
persistent cookies to save your login information so you don't have to log in
every time you visit our Service. We also utilize session cookies to enable
certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the
Service, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.
When you log off the Service and close your browser, your computer will delete
the session cookies but keep the persistent cookies. Most browsers offer
settings to stop accepting cookies entirely or prompt you before accepting a
cookie from websites you visit. Choosing  not to accept cookies may affect the
functionality of the Service.

### 2.6 Web Beacons

**"Web Beacons"** are electronic images (sometimes called single-pixel gifs)
used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze the
performance of an online service. We may use Web Beacons for this purpose. For
example, we may include Web Beacons in emails that we send you to let us know
whether or not you open them. This can help us evaluate the success of
marketing campaigns and make them better.

### 2.7 Third Party Information

**"Third Party Information"** is information about you made available from
third-party sources. As described in the [Terms](/terms), you can register to
use the Service by logging into a SN Account (for example, your Facebook,
Twitter or LinkedIn account). If you do, you will be giving us access to some
Personal Information contained in that SN Account (commonly your real name,
email address, profile picture, friends or connections on that SN, groups
you've joined on that SN, and other publicly available information you've added
to that SN). We will use that Personal Information to create your advicedrop Account,
and store such information on our Service. Some examples of Third Party
Information we might use to improve your experience on the Service include:
* We may check to see if any friends or connections of yours on a SN are also
* advicedrop Members. If we find a match, we can connect you with those friends
* automatically.  We may use friend lists from a SN so that you can choose to
* share your advicedrop Account profile page with those friends using messages
* specific to that SN service.

Please remember that we do not control the privacy practices of these SN
services, and we encourage you to read their respective privacy policies. You
may want to take another look at our [Terms of Service](/terms) (section 2) to

You can modify or delete Personal Information in your profile by contacting us
at [feedback@advicedrop.com](mailto:feedback@advicedrop.com) or editing your
profile directly via the Site or App. If you want your advicedrop Account
deactivated, we promise not to cry and you can email us at
[feedback@advicedrop.com](mailto:feedback@advicedrop.com). We will deactivate your
account if we don't have a legal obligation or legitimate business reason to
retain the information contained in your advicedrop Account. In either case, keep in
mind that your Member Content will remain publicly viewable via the Site and
App.

## 6. Security measures

To protect your privacy and information, advicedrop uses multiple security procedures
and practices to protect the Personal Information of users. While we believe
that we meet or exceed industry standards to protect your Personal Information,
no method of transferring such information over the internet or storing it
digitally is 100% secure, nor can we guarantee the absolute security of your
information. If you have any questions about security on our Service, email us
at [feedback@advicedrop.com](mailto:feedback@advicedrop.com).

### 6.1 General security

When you enter Personal Information on our Service, we encrypt that information
using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is a web security standard that
creates a secure connection between our web servers and your browser and
protects your data from unauthorized access. Your Personal Information is
password-protected and our main servers are locked and hosted by a leading
provider. Access to the host environment is secure.

### 6.2 Phishing

We're particularly concerned and cognizant of both identity theft in general
and the practice known as "phishing" specifically. **We will never request your
credit card or banking information, your advicedrop Account ID, login password, or
any other private Personal Information in a non-secure or unsolicited email or
phone call.** If someone claiming to represent advicedrop does ask for such
information unsolicited, DO NOT provide it.

### 6.3 What happens on advicedrop stays on advicedrop

Communications and Exchanges should be performed exclusively using our Service.
Keeping communication within the Service protects you and your information. Do
not request personal email addresses, Skype usernames, or other personal
contact details from other users of the Service. Sharing personal information
with and contacting other users outside of the Service may put you at risk.

### 6.4 Disclosure of breaches

We will of course make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the
security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically
stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security
breach notification). These notices will be done via email or conspicuous
posting on the Site or App as quickly as possible and without unreasonable
delay, taking into consideration the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any
measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the
integrity of the Service. In other words, if we need to stay quiet about a
breach to help the good guys catch the bad ones, we'll do that until the coast
is clear.

## 7. Jurisdictions and international transfer

advicedrop operates in the United States and processes information described in this
policy here in the U.S. Additionally, we work and share data as described in
this policy with third parties who may perform their activities in other
countries. As a result, your information as shared with advicedrop and our partners
may be subject to the laws of jurisdictions outside your own, and those laws
may not afford the same privacy and data protection laws as your home
jurisdiction's, particularly regarding demands or requests for information from
government entities. By using our Service, you agree that your information may
be collected, transferred, stored, and processed in the United States and in
other countries.
